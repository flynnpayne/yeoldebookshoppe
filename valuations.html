				<p>In determining the value of a book there are three basic elements: <br>1) Age <br>2) Scarcity <br>3) Condition. <br>Books with the most value normally have all three of these elements, and the loss of any will likely result in a loss of value.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Age</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Age of the book is not always a key factor in value.  Along with the receiving questions about a book's value, we equally frequently hear that a book is "old."  While it only takes a car 20 years to become a classic, and an item may become an antique at 100 years old, in the rare book world, 100 years is young.  As a very basic cutoff, books published before 1830 are generally considered "old."  After this date, printing methods changed, and books were published on a greater scale.  As a result, books published after 1830 are likely to be more common than those beforehand.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Scarcity</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Likewise, just because a book is rare or scarce, it still may not be of value.  Books are often rare because of a small printing due to its lack of importance.  But without demand, rarity does not, in and of itself, establish value (for instance, take a look at our shop, we have several books that cannot be found elsewhere, but (unfortunately) the demand is not high and they are still in inventory!).</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Condition</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Additionally, there are many books, particularly modern fiction, and other books published after 1900, that are quite common, but in near fine/fine condition, are much rarer.  Perhaps the most striking example is the The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Over 25 million copies have been sold since it was published in 1925, making it an extremely common book.  A used copy printed in 1925 is rather common and can bring $300.00.  A first edition, first state without a dust jacket is of significant value (given great demand), the asking price at retail is around $3,000.00, but is still relatively common with dozens available for sale at any given moment.  But a fine copy with a very good dust jacket can go for well over $100,000.00 given the rarity of copies with quality dust jackets.  Thus, rarity, combined with demand, and condition, can bring exponential increases in value.</p>
